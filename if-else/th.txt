C language provides “?” operator as a conditional operator.

These are “Ternary Operators” as they take three operands.
It is used as shown below:
Syntax:

Condition ? Expression1 : Expression2

The statement above is equivalent to:

normal if - else

        if (Condition)
            Expression1
        else
            Expression2


Nested if - else

        if (Condition)
        {
            Expression 1
        }
        else if(Condition)
        {
            Expression 2
        }
        else
        {
            Expression 3
        }
