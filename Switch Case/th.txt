what is switch case ?
-> Switch case is a control statement that allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.


syntax of switch case :

switch(expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression equals value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression equals value2
    break;
  ...
  default:
    // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}




Nested Switch case :

  switch(expression) {
  case value1:
 
    // code to be executed if expression equals value1

    switch(expression2) {
      case valueA:
        // code to be executed if expression2 equals valueA
        break;
      case valueB:
        // code to be executed if expression2 equals valueB
        break;
      ...
      default:
        // code to be executed if expression2 doesn't match any case
    }

    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression equals value2
    break;
  ...
  default:
    // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
